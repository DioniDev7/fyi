# Setting up iOS credentials in non-interactive mode

In order to set up credentials in non-interactive mode, you must do one of the following:

## Run build before in interactive mode

Set up credentials before by running the command in interactive mode. You can do this by running `eas build -p ios` or `eas credentials -p ios`.

## Upload credentials to EAS Build
